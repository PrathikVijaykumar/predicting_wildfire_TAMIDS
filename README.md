# Objective
This paper is about predicting large wildfires in the Contiguous United States using deep neural networks. It examines the severity of large wildfires across the United States over the past decade (2011-2020) using a wide array of meteorological, land cover, and topographical features in the Deep Neural Network model. The goal is to understand the factors influencing the occurrence and severity of wildfires and facilitate wildfire management and policies
